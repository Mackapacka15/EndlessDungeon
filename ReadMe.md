# Endless Dungeon

This is a endless dungeon game developed in C. This game was developed as a school projekt during the winter of 2022/2023. 

This game is a topdown mining / dungeon game. You use W, A, S, D to move and SPACE to mine. The aim of the game is to find the other door and "escape the level". Once you have escaped you get a coise on what stat you want to upgrade and then you are sent into anoter new level. The levels are generated using Cellular Automata. 

## Run the game
    ./build.sh
#### Known bugs:
Collision is a little broken. Sometimes halts movement. To fix this, relese A and or S key.

Some sprites are mssing. There are not enough tiles in the tileset to fill all possible tiles. For now they are just black walls.
